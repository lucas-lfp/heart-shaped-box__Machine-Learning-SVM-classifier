                <i>Bonjour</i> ! And thank you for the visit. My name is Lucas. I'm a pharmacist,
                with a Ph.D. in Pharmacology, and a data scientist.
                </p>

                I've got a strong background in life science, especially in clinical research. I started playing with
                data during my Ph.D., and quickly got hooked. It didn't take me long to realize that
                the tools I used were very... Limited.
                </p>
                <p>
                But the good news is, I kinda was looking for a good reason to get into programming, and ... <i>voil√†</i> !
                </p>
